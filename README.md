# AssetManager


Looks at financial plans and how to best invest

For each time step be given a state Xt decide what the best state Xt+1 given that you can only execute actions A{1,2,..n}

Each action has a cost
Each state has a value



#thory behind all of this: 
Sock values are measearments of a companys value and we can estimate the underlying value using a KF or some other filter.  
We can then see what the diffrence is between the stocks selling price and our understanding of its value.  We can then be smart about when to sell and when to buy.
